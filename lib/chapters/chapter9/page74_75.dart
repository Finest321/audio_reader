"My princess turned out to be a hideously unpresentable creature. Her face...oh, my God. You were right. It was someone else's picture she used as her DP, her displayed picture. And that was how I was deceived."
Lawal began laughing uproariously.
"My friend, what is funny here?" Salim said when Lawal would not stop laughing.
"I thought we are supposed to be talking about our new girlfriend, not about how our princess looks." He laughed some more and proceeded to tell Salim some home truths about meeting a girl on the social media.
"You are lucky," he said. "She even agrees to meet you. In other instances, she would so chat you up leeringly, invitingly, making false promises until she gets you to really fall for her, then she would start making demands. The demands begin from something as menial as a recharge card for her phone. Then gradually you graduate into sending money to her account because she would have claimed to be in another city and she wanted to come visiting. Or she would "kill" her relations and ask you to send funeral money. In another situation, she can even send you on a wild goose chase if you are that gullible. She may be just your next door neighbour and since she knows that you do not know her she may claim to be from Kano or Sokoto and ask you to come visiting. If you are stupid enough to go visiting, you would be shocked that by the time you would have travelled that long distance and called her, she would say she was not around or she had taken ill or some such nonsense. Or indeed she would just refuse to pick your call. Or, if you persist, she will just switch off her phone.
"The other extreme, and this one is really funny, is when you befriend a lady based on the picture displayed and she turned out to be a man! Here, all you need to expect is extortion. And in this time when kidnapping has become so rampant and unchecked, you need to be careful. They may well take you and ask for ransom which nobody can pay." Lawal paused in his admonition and looked at Salim who seemed to be lost in his thought.
"What is wrong, man?" he asked.
"There is something I have not disclosed to you before. It is something you have said just now about kidnapping. I have a genuine cause to thank God"
"We all do, my friend, we all do."
"No. You do not understand. This my ugly princess was not the first case I went visiting. Maybe you did not wonder why I insisted you should follow me to see her for the first time and why I insisted on seeing her in the afternoon."
"No, I did not bother to think about that."
"Well, there was an antecedent. As I said, she was not the first. I was so ashamed to tell you about this experience that happened about a month ago. At the time it was frightening, later when I was free, it became disgraceful for me to even talk about it. But now that you seem to know all about social media relationships I can tell you about Natasha."
