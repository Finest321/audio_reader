                                  CHAPTER NINE
                                    
It was not too long ago that Salim bought his first smartphone. It was the Samsung brand and it had this wide screen that responded to a stylus touch as well as the fingers of the owner. They called it the Note Series. It was really unique and he was so proud of it. Of course, it was expensive. But for someone whose marriage had not been fixed, even Salma herself encouraged him to enjoy his money before marriage responsibilities ensnared him.
He hearkened to her advice and said he was going to use the phone. He discovered several dating sites and downloaded the applications. In the beginning Salma was not aware of this. The social media was awash with many of these chat rooms and all one needed to do was to download the application of a particular chat group and one would be linked up to whoever one desired.
Salim was into all conceivable instant and distant relationship social outlets. I think they still abound. He was on Facebook, Tweeter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Badoo, 2Go, WeChat all these plus so many others that Salma could not remember their names. He told her all this after his nasty experience.
One day, Salim had gone to his friend, Lawal, all excited, and told him he had a new girlfriend.
Lawal was sitting in the living room watching his inevitable wrestling programme. He muted the sound from the remote control in his hand to better listen to his friend.
"Salim, I don't know what is wrong with you. You have Salma as fianc√©e and now you are talking about a girlfriend. What kind of life is this?"
"Point of correction, my friend. Salma is technically my wife. We are just waiting for the day to be fixed. But you know man must be allowed some moment of unchecked rascality before becoming another woman's personal property or slave."
"I guess you found yet another girl that seems to catch your fancy. Where did you meet her? She must be a quintessential beauty for you to go on about her like this. Have I met her before?"
"My friend, stop joking. You have not met her before. But you will now.
See? Come and have a look." Salim brought out his phone and showed a particular picture to Lawal.
"You did not tell me you now like Indian women." Lawal said.
"You see? She is that beautiful. She is not Indian. She said she is Fulani."
"When did you see her?"
Salim hesitated and shrugged. "I did not really meet her physically. But we
have been chatting for over one week now."
"And you are convinced that she is who she has claimed to be?"
"Sure. Why should I doubt that?"
"Why not?"
"She gave me her phone number. And I gave her mine. And by God she has such a beautiful voice. Voice befitting a princess?"
"Princess?"
"Yes."
"And how does the voice of a princess sound?"
"Look here my friend, are you accompanying me to see her or not?"
"Me? To accompany you to see a person you have never met before and yet you want to make your girlfriend? What do I tell Salma? No. Go and see her first. Subsequently, we can go together."
Salim looked at Lawal like he was going to strangle him. But suddenly, he saw the wisdom in what his friend said. What if they went and on seeing her she turned out different from what they thought? Or, worse, what if she saw him in real life and decided she did not like what she saw? That could really be embarrassing if your friend was with you.
He went ahead to see his social media princess with whom he had been chatting for over a week without seeing each other.
When he came back a few hours later, he met Lawal seated where he left him.several hours before. He was watching a different film this time around.
"Mr Romeo is back. Or do I call you Casanova? How did it go, man? How is our Indian princess?"
"Hell, my friend. Are you a clairvoyant?"
"No. What happened?"
