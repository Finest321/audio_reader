"Thereafter I drove steadily, but my heart was palpitating, till I reached home."
"What happened to them?"
"To God who made me, I do not know. My guess is they must have jumped out and disappeared into the darkness, no doubt after sustaining bruises. The thought of going to the police crossed my mind the next day but I said to hell with it. Since I was alive and healthy, why would I add police wahala to my life? No. I said let them go. One day would come when they would be caught in their shady and wicked game."   
Lawal looked at Salim and said, "You are really a wonderful guy."
"Why, because I did not tell anyone?"
"No, because you still had the heart to engage another Facebook friend in another chat."
"You mean my ugly princess? Don't worry it won't happen again."   
And it never happened again. Shortly after that incident which he narrated to Lawal, Salim got engaged to Salma.
Teemah turned her chair and looked at Omar. "So, Mr Smartphone, you have heard what you are getting yourself into. Even older people who had more sense than you escaped the evil of social media by the skin of their teeth. What guarantee do you have that you would be good?"
"Mum?"
"Omar, I do not have anything against your phone. You deserve it. Just be careful about the negative effect of the social media.
"I will, Mum, I will."
"So would you tell Teemah not to be in a hurry to tell Dad?"
"I have a better idea," I said.
"What is it, mummy?" all the girls asked as in a chorus.
"We will tell Daddy together. We sit here and wait for him to come back and as soon as he enters we would all jump and let the news come out loudly that Omar has gotten admission. That way he would be so excited whatever you ask, you would get."
"That is superb. You really know your man." The girls said all excited already.
"We will wait for Daddy," I said.
So we all remained seated there under the tree, waiting for Daddy.
