problems."
"Are they not?"
"On the contrary. They are the problem."
"And on a personal level?"
"I do not judge a person based on his affiliations."
"You don't?"
"No. I get to know who you are and judge you as such."
"So there is hope for me, after all?"
"Hope for what?"
"For becoming your friend."
"I wouldn't be sitting in your car if there wasn't."
Habib was so elated, he laughed out loud.
"How many of you are in the room?"
"Four. Why?"
"You take this." He handed over to her a bundle of five hundred naira bills. She collected the money slowly and placed it on her laps.
"Put it in your bag. I do not want Labaran to see it."
"He won't."
"Ten thousand for each of your roommates and twenty thousand for you."
"Thank you. We really appreciate this gesture."
Just then, Habib's phone rang.
"Yes, Labaran?"
"I am done with the purchases."
"Then bring them over."
"Okay, Honourable."
Labaran came with so much provisions and beverages that Tomiwa thought they were buying things for their children in the boarding school. But no. Habib said it was for her and her roommates.
Tomiwa was gratitude personified. She thanked Habib profusely and did not know when she started calling him Alhaji.
Haib too was very happy. He drove her to the entrance and promised to call her regularly.
As soon as Tomiwa entered the room, they started shouting and ululating. The shout turned into a scream of joy when they saw what she brought. It was Ngozi who had the presence of mind to stand up and lock the door. This simple act is one of the most valued rituals of students who cook in the hostel. It effectively blocks out all those professional hangers who go about with spoon in their purses looking for the pot that had just been brought down from the stove. Before you start eating you lock the door and if it was night, you switched off the light. If they knocked you ignore. When Ngozi came back from the door, they opened the bags and saw what was almost beyond belief. Even if they had come to the school with nothing, what the Alhaji had bought for them would have lasted them through another semester. They jumped some more and were embracing Tomiwa. And thanking her.
When the excitement died down, Salma said, "You guys should be thanking me. It was I who brought this matter here, you know?"
"But if we had followed your counsel we would all be without these. It is Tomiwa we should thank. It is her boyfriend who supplied all these."
Somehow Salma was not happy with the turn of events. "Stop disgracing yourselves like this my friends. Is it suya that you have not seen or chicken or beverages?"
"Or these?" Tomiwa said dramatically as she dropped the bundle of fifty thousand naira before them.
They were all stunned. For one brief moment there was total silence in the room. Tomiwa savoured the moment and used it to divide the money the way she was instructed. Ten thousand naira for each occupant. And she held unto the remaining twenty thousand.
This was all too much for Salma.
In the silence that followed, she was heard to have whispered, "It is not fair. It is not fair. Finders, keepers. It was me they gave ride to. Tomiwa, you are not a good friend at all. I just showed you a guy and you went ahead to make him your boyfriend.
