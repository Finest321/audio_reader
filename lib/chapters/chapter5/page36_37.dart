                              CHAPTER FIVE
                                
By eight o'clock in the evening the next day, Tomiwa's phone rang.
She jumped at the first ring as if she was not expecting it. The truth was that she had been waiting for that call all through the day. She had never been on a blind date before and she never knew how she was expected to behave. The whole thing sounded crazy. But she was curious. In spite of her apparent social exposure and her confidence which was borne out of her desire to become a celebrity, Tomiwa was emotionally empty. She was beautiful no doubt about it. Indeed she could beat Salma in a contest except that she was dark where Salma was fair. Otherwise they were slim, busty and definitely attractive. So how was it that no boy ever attempted to go out with Tomiwa? The answer could be summed up in one word - overconfidence. She exuded such charismatic air around her that people, both males and females alike, rated her far above her station. Which station nobody knew. Consequently all of them felt intimidated in her presence. And she was an expensive dresser. It was not that the materials she sewed were out of this world, it was the style. That was definitely out of this world.
Her phone rang again for the second time.
"Hello," she said turning on the speaker so that her roommates, all the three of them, could hear what was being said.
"Is this Tomiwa?"
"Yes, who is speaking, please?"
She looked up at her roommates and they gave her the thumbs up sign, indicating that she was doing well.
"My name is Habib. We gave you a ride yesterday from Kwangila?" Tomiwa paused, unsure whether to go ahead with the lie or to tell the truth and forget the whole thing.
"Hello?" the voice at the other end was hesitant. "Are you still there?"
"Yes, I am."
"Can you come out, please?"
"Okay. Where are you?"
"We are parked where we dropped you yesterday."
"Er, er, yes. Okay. I will be with you."
There was silence at the other end.
"Go, my friend. They won't eat you. If I know men, they may not even know the difference between you and me." Salma was very confident.
Tomiwa on the other hand was hesitant. Indeed she started developing cold feet about the whole thing. What if they turned out to be some kidnappers or cultists? Who would come to her rescue if she entered a car with total strangers who formed the habit of visiting girls in the hostel only when it was night time? These thoughts were passing through her mind even as she picked her handbag and casually walked out of the room to meet her unknown visitors.
She saw the black Mercedes Benz parked directly in front of the hostel. The passenger side was empty so she went and entered the car without prompting. It was strange. There were supposed to be two people in the car. "Where is your friend?"
"Oh, my beauty, I am here," Labaran said from the back seat. "I made space for you in the front so you can seat near your heartthrob."
Far from being reassuring, this unexpected utterance and seating arrangement made Tomiwa even more uncomfortable. She had read so many thriller stories, particularly Mario Puzo's Godfather and she knew how enemies were easily garrotted when they are made to sit in the passenger side while unbeknownst to them their killers were seated directly behind them in the car. She did not let her fear show. Instead, she just opened the front seat, stepped out of the car and asked Labaran to come to the front seat. Meekly, he obeyed.
As she entered the back seat, Habib took a long look at her and seemed to be convinced that there was something wrong about the lady who just entered their car. She was more resolute and a trifle more confident than the girl of the previous night. But he told himself, he would wait and see. There was a game plan somewhere, and he did not want to spoil it.
