"That is hardly the way to show gratitude to people who just fed us without asking for anything in return." Tomiwa said this light-heartedly.
Ngozi however read something serious underlying the statement.
"My sister, just mark my words. No man spends this much money on you without asking for something in return. Just wait and see. Men are not stupid, you know. Sooner or later, they would ask for their pound of flesh. This was just the first day, and see what he spent."
That was precisely Tomiwa's thought. It was just the first day, and see how much she gained. If this went on, she had nothing to say to Salma but gratitude. Let Ngozi talk on about the pound of flesh. I would give them fifty pounds of flesh if they asked. How much were they getting from Ngozi's stupid campus boyfriends? They gave nothing and yet they kept asking for pounds of flesh! Make I hear word,
They looked alarmingly at each other, as if chiding themselves that because of their attitude another party was coming to partake in the harvest of a farm produce they never lifted their hands in farming.
When they heard the footsteps of the knocker receding, they sat down quietly around the roasted meat and chicken Tomiwa came in with. At a signal from Salma, Ada went and switched off the light in the room. Thereafter, they used light from the inbuilt torch on their phones to see what they were eating. It was strange to see this total cooperation among the people who a few seconds before were at each other's throat. The herd instinct was indeed real. A situation which no entreaty could settle, was suddenly resolved by a single knock on the door.
They ate silently and for a long time.
They discovered that they could not finish the meat and the chicken. So Ada was instructed to keep what was left in her fridge so they could use it the next day while cooking their meals.
When the room was cleared, Ngozi switched on the light after unlocking the door.
She told the other girls that there was no point for them to harbour any ill feelings over what had transpired. If truth be told, didn't they all enjoy themselves as a result of the recklessness of some silly old men who could not resist dropping their purse at the sight of a bra?

They gave nothing and yet they kept asking for pounds of flesh! Make I hear word, jareh! As these thoughts were passing through Tomiwa's mind, she did not hear what the other girls were saying. For a while.
Then Salma asked a very strange question. "When did they say they are coming again?"
"Who?"
"Labaran and Habib," Salma said, looking very serious.
"Are you kidding me? Salma? What the hell comes over you?"
