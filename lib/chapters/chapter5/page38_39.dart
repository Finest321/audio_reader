"Shall we move from here? It is rather too open."
"Where are we going?"
"To a restaurant."
"I am not hungry." Tomiwa was really ill disposed with the whole set up.
She felt the stab of Habib's long stare as she entered the car and she knew the man was not dumb even before he said anything.
"Let's go to Frizzlers then." Habib said this as he manoeuvred the car to face where it came from so they could drive quietly to the Fast Food Restaurant which was surrounded by many grocery shops within the school.
He parked the car near the shop of a man who proclaimed his shop the Faculty of Suya. This meant that his shop was the best place where steaks are made and sold. As they parked, Habib asked Labaran to go out and get them fried rice, chicken, milk, tea, beverages, sugar, and any other thing that he considered important to a boarding student.
"Yes, Honourable." He went out of the car without collecting money from Habib. This Tomiwa noted as strange. But she also knew instantly that authority had been established. She knew now who was the boss. Salma was wrong. Labaran may own the car, but he most certainly was not the one calling the shots. Habib was. And he appeared very perceptive. Tomiwa instinctively knew that Habib was not the kind of person you trifled with.
"You are not Tomiwa." Habib said this categorically when Labaran was out of earshot.
For some reason the statement made Tomiwa angry. "Look here, Mr. Honourable. I do not care who you think you are. But you cannot just wake up this evening and declare my name fake. That is very insulting. If you had said, "Hey, you are not the girl I picked yesterday." I would gladly say, "Yes, I was not. Since you are an expert at picking girls by the roadside. My name is Tomiwa. And I am not the girl you gave ride to yesterday." She added this last to soften the venom she knew her words must have caused.
"I am sorry, my dear. I didn't mean to sound like that. And believe me picking girls is not my habit. As you can see, it was Labaran's idea. He is my driver."
"I do not have any issue with you or your driver. I would not insult you for anything if you do not look down on me."
"I said I am sorry."
"Okay. Just so long as we understand each other."
"I think I like you already."
She didn't say anything to this.
"So, tell me what happened?"
"Nothing happened. My friend didn't feel like giving you her number so she gave you mine instead. I was supposed to reject your call or, tell you wrong number, but my curiosity got the better part of me. I decided to come and see who it was that had my number."
"And...?"
"And here we are."
"I just declared that I liked you."
"I heard you."
"And what are you saying to that."
"Nothing."
"Why?"
"Because I do not go about declaring likeness or otherwise to people whose faces I can hardly recognise in the daytime?"
"Fine. That means you want to see me tomorrow in the afternoon."
"Yes."
"Is that why you told my driver to come to the front seat?"
"No. I just did not want to take chances. What of if he sprang on me and strangled me from behind?"
"You have a very wild imagination."
"Thank you."
There was another long silence.
"If we have nothing left to say to each other, I guess I should be going in," Tomiwa said.
"You didn't even ask me who I am."
"Your friend or is it your driver has said who you are. Indeed, I am not sure if I like politicians," Tomiwa was in her element. She never gave a thought to what she was saying. If it went down well with her listeners, fine. If it did not, also fine.
"Why don't you like politicians?" Habib asked.
"They are like a spindle. Nobody knows the direction they are facing. They lie a lot. A lot of misguided people think the politicians are the solutions to our
