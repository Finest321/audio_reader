"Mummy?"
"Yes, Bint. What is it?"
"I want to drink zobo."
"I can buy that for everybody," Omar said. "Teemah, bring five bottles of zobo."
"Bring the money first."
Omar turned to look balefully at me. "You see, mum. Teemah does not even trust me."
I just sat there smiling.
"When it comes to money, Omar," Teemah said, "do you, even you, do you trust yourself?"
"I sure do."
"How many times did you take my zobo without paying?"
"That was different. I was not an undergraduate then. Now, you are
talking to a potential lawyer. See, young girl? You'd better watch it. You
could be in trouble one day and your only brother here would be called upon
to defend you. I would remind you of this day, believe me."
"Teemah, go and get the zobo," I said, "I would pay."
"Thank you, mum."
By this time Bint and Jamila were done cleaning the chairs. We sat as close to each other as the white plastic chairs would allow and waited for Teemah to bring the zobo. There was a very joyous atmosphere in the air and nobody wanted to spoil it.
Then all of a sudden Bint said, "Mummy, tell us a story?"
Before I could answer, Teemah was back with five bottles of zobo on a plastic tray and squatted to serve us.
That got me thinking. Bint wanted me to tell them a story. But it was a different story that came to my mind. Omar was going to a new environment. Until now, he had been ensconced in this Lafayette community of ours. He was going to town. The university was a civilized community, different from ours. And with so much freedom one didn't know what to do with it. May be I should tell them about my experiences in the university. But how interesting could that be? My life before marriage had always been one dreary thing after another. That surely was not the kind of story someone like Bint, or the remaining children for that matter, would want to hear. It certainly was not the kind of story my exuberant son would like to hear. I decided not to bother about any story. Let the story, whatever its angle or angles, come naturally or not at all. I knew though that since my marriage coincided with my entry into the university, and so much drama was witnessed then, my children may have a peep into that life. Like I said, however, I would not make a deliberate effort at personal narration.
We still had like two or three hours before their father returned from work. Me? The joy of a teacher was that as long as the school was over, she too was free to rest till the next day. I had time. I would ask Omar about his admission first. How did he go about getting it when no one raised a finger to help him?
"You see, mum," Omar told me even as his siblings listened. "There is always a silver lining in the cloud. After I passed SSCE examinations, by no means a small feat, even if I am saying it..."
"What do you mean by that immodest remark? By no means a small feat! Well done William Shakespeare." That was Teemah, always looking for her brother's trouble, as they say.
"Mum, tell this big mouth to stop interrupting a lawyer when he is speaking." Then he turned to address Teemah herself. "Don't you know how many of my colleagues had their exams sat for? Don't you know how many parents paid big money to these so called Miracle Centres where no candidate fails their exams? Don't you think I have a right to boast of my achievement when I scored seven credits including English and Mathematics at the very first attempt in my WAEC examination? It is by no means a small feat, my dear sister. Don't let me curse your efforts, you hear? Otherwise I would say yours is soon coming and I would see what you
