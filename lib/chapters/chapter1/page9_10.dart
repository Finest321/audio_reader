Teemah sensed Omar was slightly hurt. She stopped taunting him. And he went on with his story.
"After the WAEC results were out, we purchased the JAMB form, filled it online and submitted. While people were running helter-skelter from one school to another looking for whom to assist them with their children's admission, I prayed that I should pass the matriculation exams well.

"Yes."
"What does that mean, Mum?"
"It means it changes your life" Teemah said. "It means more than that, my dear. It means it also changes you."
"How can it change me?"
"Well, I may not be able to categorically tell you how it can change you. But I know how my admission changed me."
"How, mum?"
