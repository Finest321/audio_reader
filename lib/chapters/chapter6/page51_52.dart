God, do not give them chance to kill me too. I promise to renew my ways. I will re-
establish my relationship with you. I know where I was wanting. You made us, and
you made us fallible. So please forgive our trespasses.
Salma kept praying silently till they reached the office of the Head of Department. The last time she was there was two years ago when she had issues with her add and drop forms. Even then she did not see the HOD. The secretary attended to them. In any case, even if she had seen him, he would not have been in a position to help her since a new HOD had taken over about six months before the examinations started.
Whoever the new HOD would be Salma prayed she would find compassion in his eyes.
The secretary asked them to wait so she could tell her boss that they wanted to see him.
She went in, announced their arrival and came out.
"He said you could go in, ma." The secretary addressed the invigilator. She went in after instructing Salma, Kola and the other witness to wait. "Good morning, sir."
"Good morning, Dr Amina."
"Sir, we have one case."
"EMAL?"
"Yes."
"Final Year?"
"Yes."
"Boy or girl?"
"Girl."
"That's rare. How bad?"
"Very bad."
"That means you caught her with the cheat notes and all?"
"Yes, sir."
"She has signed the form?"
"Yes, sir".
"And the witnesses?"
"Yes."
"Okay. Let them come in."
The lecturer opened the door, stuck her head out of the door and motioned with her head for them to come in.
They all trooped in into the HOD's office.
Salma was the last in tow.
The lecturer closed the door after her.
As they entered, he looked at the invigilating lecturer and said, with coldness in his voice, "Doctor, prepare the documents for the Exams and Ethics Committee for further processing. I am sure you know this is beyond me."
"Okay, sir." She said and went out.
"I can just imagine." Omar was beside himself with excitement. "Mum, this reads like a story of fiction. Honestly, if you were not the one telling us, I would have said you made it all up."
I smiled at my son without saying a word.
"Then what happened to Salma?" he asked. "Sadly, when she was summoned by the committee, she implicated Kolawole Abdul. He too was also expelled."
"Mum! How wicked can this girl be? You mean..."
I extended my hand and touched his shoulder. "Rules are rules, my son. If you do not want to get caught, then don't break them."
Omar looked at me strangely and I knew what the unasked question meant.
"You see?" I told him, "Salma knew what she was doing all along. And she did not just go down without a fight.
