After she signed, some calm was restored in the examination hall and all the students wrote till they finished. A female student who was sitting on the other side of Salma was also asked to sign the second witness form. She did. The lecturer assured them that if Salma was lucky the whole incident would not go beyond the HOD's office.
When they were done writing the Moral Philosophy paper, Salma followed the teacher to the HOD's office.
One thing she was not so sure about was that though she did not know who the new HOD was, students were full of praises for his goodness and compassion. She had been in the school for four years and she never had any altercation with teaching staff. She did her best to avoid them. She made sure she had no relationship of any kind with any of her teachers. Most of the friends she had among the academic staff were in the other faculties. This particular HOD, her own HOD, they said he was very kind. So she was sure she would find compassion in his eyes.
But the thought of what would happen if things went the other way was heart-wrenching. Salma found herself shedding tears even before anyone reprimanded her. She knew what she did was wrong. But students were doing it all over. So why should she be this unlucky. Exams Malpractice at final year, in the last semester and while writing the last paper... Was this a curse or something? Please God, let this cup pass over me.
The invigilator told Salma not to worry. "Our HOD is a benevolent man. He is kind and loves the progress of his students. This is not the first time I take cases to him. Usually he would admonish the students and warn them never to repeat what they did. And the matter would die there. I do not see how your case would be different."
"But, madam" Salma said through her tears, "You should have allowed me be. You should have ignored me. You should have just seized the paper and the matter would have died in the class."
"And I would have lost my job. You have no idea how many years I put in to get to where I am. In any case, what did you do to warrant that kind of action from me? You know the rules. With or without me, the security man would have noticed and he would have reported. No, my dear, this is the best way to handle it. Let the Head of Department who has authority to handle this matter handle it. Believe me,
you have nothing to worry about. You will see."
As they walked towards the office of the HOD, Salma was in prayers as
she had never prayed before. She knew she would never be counted among the
holiest people. But still she had faith. She knew, particularly in this regard, and
where it concerned the issue of exams malpractices, she was a first offender. And
even in courts first offenders were treated genially. She resolved never to
misbehave again if God gave her another chance. University was not a life or death
affair. But when you came to 400Level last semester exams, it looked like it - a life
or death affair.
Please God do not let me be rubbished like this. I have not been a very
good girl, I know. But I also know you are all forgiving and merciful. Please God, in
the name of all that is holy, deliver me. Let me look at this wicked woman and laugh.
I know she is laughing at me inside. Generally, I know that women don't like me,
especially my lecturers. But is it my fault, God, that you made me this beautiful, this
youthful? I know their problem. Envy. My looks and age are killing them. Please,
