    He nodded into his file then casually asked me if I needed something to drink.

"No, thank you sir." I said rather too quickly. Suddenly the office was becoming oppressive. I developed an instant, irrepressible feeling of claustrophobia. Why would your Head of Department offer you a drink just because you went for registration? This was how it got started. I decided to tell him I was married but I quickly changed my mind. One thing I learnt in life is never to volunteer information unless specifically asked.

"You look beautiful and decent in your attire," he said as he stood up to come and sit on the sofa near the visitor's chair, where I was seated.

This was too much, I thought. Why would he be trying to make conversation with me when all I wanted was the matric number? Suddenly the image of Salma loomed over my face. I could hear her saying all lecturers are the same. If you are a boy they ask you for money, and if you are a girl they ask you for a date.

Surely this man would not be trying to make a pass at me. What was his business with my attire? I knew I was not wearing my hijab, but I was dressed in such a way that even those wearing the hijab would wish they were that covered. Of course my entire face was exposed. I did not think there was anything wrong with that.

Indeed, my husband and I had since come to the conclusion that the recalcitrant male would always misbehave irrespective of what the woman wears. This put me on my guard.

"Our students should emulate your style of dressing. I hope you are as intelligent upstairs as you are decent in appearance. You are better than I imagined." Something was wrong either with my hearing or with the man seated beside me on the sofa. He looked every inch responsible. Yet I could not make head or tail of what he was blabbering about.

All I wanted was to get out of that office.

You are better than I imagined. What the hell was the meaning of that?

"Sir, please can I have my matric number now? I am pressed." That last was a lie. I just wanted him to let me go. His response shocked me.

"No problem, my dear, you can use my toilet."

"No, sir. It is not allowed,"

"Who disallowed it? This is my office, remember?"

"Unless of course if you were not pressed in the first place."

"No, I was...I am. Ok. Thank you, sir." I was totally confused. I knew it was improper what I said. And now I was committed.

He stood up and went and sat behind his desk, perchance to give me room to manoeuvre and enter the toilet.

I mustered enough courage and entered the toilet.

I came out a few moments later after flushing the toilet. It made a satisfactory gurgling noise which to my car convinced the man that I must have discharged something. Still the feeling was uncomfortable. Indeed it was very embarrassing. I am not sure if I would be able to face the man again.

He was buried in the file before him. I told myself that I had enough embarrassment for one day. With or without the number I was leaving.

"Here is your matric number," he said, as if reading my thoughts. "You are UG0001. I pray as you are the first here, you would be the first in everything."

For some reason I was genuinely angry with this surreptitious overture.

"Thank you," I said almost rudely and made my way out of the office.

He still found it necessary to send his secretary after me to inform me that I had to proceed to the 100 Level Coordinator for further registration.
