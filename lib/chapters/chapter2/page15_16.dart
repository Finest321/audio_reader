    All eyes were now on the young lecturer who had all along been staying with us and was enduring what we were going through as his office was being cleaned.

As for Salma, she just stood there shivering like some rain drenched chicken.

The man calmly walked by us, opened his office and before he entered said, "Please be orderly. We would soon be done with the screening exercise. Maintain the first come, first served order. Thank you."

He disappeared into the office.

All eyes now turned to Salma.

She was suddenly bereft of words. She was fidgeting and was busy looking at the design of her shoes all the remaining period till my turn came and I entered to be screened.

Within a very short time I was done and I proceeded to the department for my matriculation number and other matters. I did not see Salma again till some few months into the semester.

"Wow. That was thrilling." Teemah was beside herself with laughter.

"Just wait till I tell you what happened during my departmental registration.

"What happened, Mum?" Omar asked.

I was not to know what transpired before I came to departmental office. The secretary was busy hitting away at her computer. She was visibly a woman of few words. She raised her head, assessed that I was a new student and asked what she could do for me.

I said I was there for my matric number.

She just nodded towards the door beside her. On it was written HOD.

I knocked timidly at the door and waited.

"Come in," came the rasp reply.

I went in and was shocked to find that the HOD here was also a very young person. He sat resplendent behind his mighty desk and was scribbling away on some paper as I entered.

He stopped writing and looked up. I saw at once that he had tribal marks which were rare in these times. They betrayed his ancestral origin. He was obviously an Igala person or Yoruba. I had no doubt about that. The crucifix dangling across his chest from the necklace he wore told me his religious inclination. I was instantly filled with apprehension without knowing why.

"Yes, young lady, what can I do for you?" he asked.

"I am a new student, sir. I came for my matric number." I was still standing.

"Sit down, my dear."

I sat down.

I know that I would always pass a test on etiquette. You are in a person's office, you never sit down even if there are a hundred other unoccupied seats until you are invited to sit. For some reason, I found his endearing salutation slightly discomforting. You do not just go about calling everybody your dear. Unless he meant something. I was immediately on my guard. The kind of things I heard Salma say about university lecturers filled me with foreboding. Of course the young lecturer who talked to her was humble and nice. That ought to have dispelled my doubts. But it did not. I still had some reservations.

The name pennon on his desk said simply, SAMUEL JOHNSON, PhD.

"You are among the first to report for registration," he said.

"Yes, sir." I responded, wishing he would just assign me my number and get done with it.

"What is your name?" he asked as he pulled a file towards himself. We were still analogue then. But I do not think a lot of things have changed since my schooling days, concerning record keeping, I mean.

"My name is Ummi Ahmad," I said.
