I distinctly remember seeing him smile as I left his office. I was too angry to make anything of the smile at the time.

"But why were you angry, mummy?" Bint asked curiously.

"To tell you the truth I really didn't know then. With knowledge of hindsight now, I think I was angrier at myself than I was at him because, really he didn't say or do anything rude that would warrant such reaction."

"So what happened after you saw the Coordinator."

My registration went on smoothly from that moment on and by the end of the day, that was around four o'clock in the evening, I was thoroughly exhausted. I took a tricycle home.


    "And what is a tricycle, mummy?" Bint asked.

"Keke Napep." Teemah replied her curtly. "Continue, mummy."

By the time I got home your father was not yet back from the office. I hurriedly prepared his dinner which he normally took early and had my bath. When he returned, I waited for him to eat and rest and I was about to start narrating the story of my first day in the university when he said, "You just can't be too sure with people these days."

"Yes, dear. What happened?"

"Mhm. It is a long story. It has to do with our neighbour."

"Which of them?"

    "The quiet one."

"The quiet one? That man cannot harm a fly?"

"You never know with people, my dear."

Suddenly, that expression reminded me of my experience at the office of the HOD earlier.

"Yes," I said, "You never know with people. Imagine what happened to me in school today?"

He seemed to suddenly remember.

"I am sorry, sweetheart, what happened in the school? Please forgive me. I

forgot to ask."

I told him nothing much happened. Then I went ahead to narrate my registration experience that morning.

From the long queue at the first registration point, to the Salma incident and down to the HOD's office. I left nothing out. Indeed as I told him about the HOD I supplied additional commentary on the incident. I did not bother hiding my anger.

My husband was listening to me with a bemused expression on his face. I didn't quite understand his facial expression.

"What is his name?" my husband asked.

"I cannot really remember, dear. Why?"

"Is it Dr. Samuel Johnson?"

I was shocked.

"Yes," I said, simply.

"Is his face scarified?"

I looked blankly at him.

"I mean, does he have tribal marks on his face?"

"Yes, he has. He looks like an Igala or a Yoruba man. Do you know him?"

. My husband doubled up in feats of laughter, he almost fell out of his chair. Then he got hold of himself and affected a seriousness which I knew he did not feel and looked almost pitifully at me.

"He is Yoruba," he said. "That is Dr. Samjohn, alright. He is my friend."

I stared open-mouthed at my husband.

He saw the surprise on my face and added, "Actually, he was the one who assisted me with your admission."
