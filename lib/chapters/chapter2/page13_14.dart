She was last on the queue but would not stay at her place. One young man addressed her politely and said, "Young lady, some of these people have been here for far longer than you have been and are patient enough to wait for the lecturer to get ready so they could all proceed to the next level of the registration exercise."

"You don't know these people as I do," Salma said. "If you wait here that is how they would keep you till dusk doing nothing. They have nothing to do but to frustrate you. They are like the policeman at the checkpoint. If they stop you with unnecessary queries, it is not so much because they want bribe, this is a given, but sometimes they want to delay you as long as possible to keep them company till the next vehicle arrives. It can be so lonely manning the road as a policeman."
"You mean there is no difference between your lecturers and the policemen on the road?" the young man asked.

"They are all the same. In fact you are better off with the policeman because at once you know where you are with him. Whether you are right or wrong, just grease his palms and he would allow you to pass. With lecturers you do not even know where you stand. As a boy they would ask you for money; as a girl they would ask you for a date."

"Just like that?"

"What do you mean just like that? Of course, it is in return for a favour desired. Like the monkey in this office, whoever he is... I mean, you cannot just leave people standing on the queue while you are inside doing nothing. So if I have the opportunity, I would just go in, give him two or three thousand naira to pocket and he would attend to me."

"You are sure about that, my dear?"

"Sure. But why are you asking me so many questions?" Salma removed

her sunshades and looked intently at the young man interrogating her. "I just find your allegation a trifle sweeping. Too general, if you ask me."

"You don't know these lecturers as I do. This is not my first university, you know."

"I can imagine," the man said.

"Just now, you were saying if we allow you to go in you could influence the man to get the registration process started?"

"Yes, please. Money moves mountains," Salma said. "I thought it was faith, in the original."

"Never mind," Salma said, putting her glasses back on. The man cleared his throat and addressed us, "Ladies and gentlemen, can we please allow this... What is your name?" He turned to Salma. "Salma Mohammed."

"Ladies and gentlemen, can we please allow Salma Mohammed here to precede us to see the lecturer so that the registration can get started?"

"Yes." We all answered in unison. Just then, the lecturer's door opened and the man inside came out with wet duster in his hand. He turned and locked the office.

We all kept quiet. Baffled.

"The office is ready now, sir," the man said, turning to address no other person than the young man who had been engaging Salma in conversation.

I did not understand what was happening at first. No one did. Meanwhile, Salma had removed her glasses for the second time and was looking at the young man strangely. Speechlessly.

Comprehension dawned on us almost at once.

Everybody kept quiet.

The man with the duster stretched out his hand and gave the young man the office key.

"Thank you, John," the young man said.

"Is there anything more you want me to do, sir?"

"No, John. Just try to be faster with the cleaning job. It is not good to keep our new students waiting, you know."

"I am sorry, sir. I am sorry, my dear students." John turned and hurriedly walked away from the scene.
