If the whole thing is cleared, we can come here again and celebrate. Just the two of us. What do you think?"
"That is very smart of you," the Chairman said enigmatically. "But you still haven't told me how much you have in mind for you and
your people."
"Maybe two hundred thousand would do," the Chairman said.
"If I have two hundred thousand, I would use it to get admission in any of these private universities," Salma spoke with a confidence she did not know she possessed. She knew they were in a hotel all by themselves. And the man was talking freely, not minding the risk of being secretly recorded by her. Maybe it did not matter to him one way or the other. He knew she was the one whose life was hanging on the line.
"So how much are you parting with?" he asked.
"I would give you one hundred thousand. And it had better work. If it does not, I would so scream and you would not hear the last of this. Remember, you have more to lose than me, when the chips are down."
"No problem. But subtle threats would not help you under this circumstance. You are hardly in a position to make bargains. I just agreed to the sum because I know you are a student who needs help."
She dipped her hand into the handbag she carried and gave him the money. He collected it, divided the bundle into two and thrust them in his trouser pockets.
Suddenly a strange thought occurred to her and she voiced it out.
"Sir, I do not even know your name."
He laughed. "Of what use would my name be to you?"
"If you are not divulging your name, then we might as well..."
"Okay, okay. Dr Kabir. Mohammed Kabir."
"Okay. I would be leaving now."
"Be seeing you," he said and opened his arms for a hug.
She declined and offered her hand for a handshake instead. Thereafter, she walked calmly out of the hotel and went home.
When she was called to defend herself before the committee, she was first shocked to see that the person seated on the chair facing her, was not the person to whom she had given the money in the hotel.
Dr Kabir was not a member of the Committee.
This was not possible. She looked again, peering closely and without shame at each member of the committee, still she could not see him. She did not start crying until she discovered that the man whom she hardly knew, who claimed to also be a member of the committee and who introduced her to Dr Kabir was also not there.
I have been duped. She told herself and began to cry. The man who was at the helm of affairs and other members of the committee mistook her tears for remorse and perhaps repentance. They advised her to calm down and narrate what transpired at the examination hall that day.
She calmed herself and told them the whole story. In the heat of her agitation, she did not know when she told them that she actually received the cheat notes from Kolawole Abdul.
"And who is Kolawole Abdul?" a member of the committee asked.
"He is my classmate."
"Is that all? Just a classmate? And he would risk his academic career, discounting the possibility of rustication, for just a classmate?"
Salma's stomach sank. In fact she did not know the implication of dropping Kolawole's name. Why did she make a slip like that? She pestered the boy to help her the way he pestered her to go out with him and she declined saying she preferred they remained good friends. He had agreed and kept his word and distance. In the end, however, she gave in because he was giving her private tutorials. And he was the brightest. But for him to risk his academic life for her? And this was the way she was repaying him? It was not fair. It simply was not fair.
It was also not fair what men were doing to her. No man ever treated her for her essence; they all related to her based on her looks. And all they ever seemed to want from her was dating her. That included Kolawole. She mentally ran the
