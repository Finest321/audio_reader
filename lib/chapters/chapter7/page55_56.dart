"Honourable," she began and paused.
"Yes?"
"There has to be someone else."
"Like who do you have in mind?" the honourable reclined on his chair and took a long look at Salma. Then a thin, mischievous smile played across the corners of his lips.
He pressed an invisible button on his desk, and the entrance door automatically locked. Salma did not notice this surreptitious movement.
"Like the Chairman of the EMEC, that is, the Chairman of the Exams Malpractice and Ethics Committee. He is a professor of Biological Sciences."
"What makes you think he would agree to our request?"
"Because they said the man likes money a lot."
"Chairman of the University Ethics Committee being susceptible to financial underhandedness? That is a laugh." Honourable Habib actually laughed out loud.
"When it comes to money, every man has his price," Salma said, laughing with him.
He stood up from his chair and came to sit on the three long sofa nearest to Salma.
"I like that philosophy about every man having his price," he said. "But what of every woman."
"Ours is a given. But sometimes who is doing the pricing matters," she said meaningfully.
"Like, do I matter?" Habib said
She said, "If you do not lose the matter at hand."
"I will not. We were talking about the Chairman of your committee."
"Yes. I made my own research and people said he can sell his mother's soul if the price is right."
"So like how much do you think we could offer him?"
"Two, may be three hundred thousand."
"And if I give you that amount, what do I expect in return?" "When I gave you Tomiwa, what did you give me in return?"
"You didn't give me Tomiwa, remember? She was to be your escape route because you didn't like me. It turned out that she did not mind going out with me. So the benefit is all hers. Now, the deal is different."
"How different?" Salma asked.
"You want two or three hundred thousand naira. And I said what do I get in return?"
"Don't be mischievous, Honourable. First, you know that the money is not for me. Secondly you know how we are with Labaran, your friend. And thirdly you know my relationship with Tomiwa, your girlfriend. So if what I suspect you are asking is true, you would know that it is not proper."
"We are not talking about propriety here, my dear. However else you choose to look at it, it is me who is going to lose money. I have no intention of trading arguments with you. But why would I want to give money to the Chairman of the committee? You. Why would your relationship with Labaran affect what we are doing here? Did he not himself bring you in here? And Tomiwa? Who would tell her? Me or you?"
Salma shifted uncomfortably. She was thinking quickly. Would he really give her that kind of money? If he did, would she be stupid enough to hand over everything to the Committee Chairman? If she didn't, what would she have to lose? But wait. Let's cross the bridge when we get to it.
"I understand you, Honourable. But would you give me the money?"
"Sure, if you cooperate."
"But your door is open, Honourable."
"No. It is locked."
Salma was surprised.
The most interesting thing was that even after she got the money from Honourable Habib, Salma found it hard put to give it to the Chairman directly. She met one of the members of the committee who introduced her to the chairman outside the school. The chairman asked her if she was guilty. She said she was guilty but that she wanted him to temper justice with mercy.
The chairman agreed and asked her to meet him at a designated rendezvous, a hotel very far away from the school. She went there all right, but declined sleeping with him. She however offered to ransom herself.
"Just how much do you think you are worth under the circumstance?"
"You tell me, sir."
"You know that I am not the only member of the committee. There are four other members. And their palms would also need greasing."
"I know that. And that is why I do not agree to what you were suggesting earlier.
