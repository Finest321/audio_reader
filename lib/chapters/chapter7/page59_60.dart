whole gamut of the men she knew in her life and came to the conclusion that except for her father, no man, indeed no man, was worthy of being called a man. So to hell with Kolawole, and Habib, and Labaran, Dr Kabir and all the others who claimed they were helping her by exploiting her. Hahahaha, she laughed inwardly. And Dr Kabir was going to pay. He was the one who took money from her.
Instinctively she knew now that she was not going to escape. She was going to be expelled. She knew that.
"Miss Salma?" the Chairman prompted when he saw that she was lost in her unpleasant reverie.
"Yes, sir?"
"Are you telling the committee that this Kolawole of a fellow who supplied the notes to you just did it because you are classmates?"
"Yes, sir."
"You have to tell the committee the truth. We do not believe anyone can be that stupid. Just tell us the truth. Your secret is safe with us."
"Sir, with all due respect, I do not see the relevance of your prying into my personal life. This is an exams malpractice committee. It is not the Student Disciplinary Committee. Moreover I do not see how my relationship with him one way or the other has any bearing on this case."

"Okay. Can we have his number?"
"Yes," Salma said and gave out the number.
"We are very sure you know the implication of what you did?"
"What did I do again?" Salma raised her brow in affected innocence.
"I mean, you know the implication of examination malpractice?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, that is about all for now. You may go."
Salma hesitated.
"You will hear from us," the chairman said.
Salma walked out solemnly though she managed to walk out with a gait of desperate dignity.
"Mum, what did she mean by saying Dr Kabir would pay for it?" I looked at Omar and smiled.
