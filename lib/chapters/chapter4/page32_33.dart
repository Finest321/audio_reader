serious. How do you defend yourself before a committee when they asked you to explain what you meant by wanting to know someone more intimately? God, please, let it never come to this. What kind of devil prompted me to let my guard low so?
But the insult... The insult was painful. It was deep and painful. But he had it coming. If the bird chooses to fly in a cloudy weather, it should expect its flight to be cut by the rain.
For a long time after Salma left, Dabo was lost in supplication. Please, God, clothe me in the garb of your holy prophets. Let not this mishap have impact on my life. If you guard me from this. Lord, I promise to be more dedicated and pious in the discharge of my duties and responsibilities as a moral custodian of our children here. Now and in the future. Thank you, Lord, for answered prayers.
On her own part, Salma did not even spare a thought to the fumbling old
man who could not even articulate himself properly when trying to ask a girl out. He
did not belong to her class. People with no confidence in themselves hardly fit the
category of those she would consider her friends.
So, as she went out of Dabo's office, so did his thought go out of her head. She walked briskly to the hostel and concluded her accommodation registration.
The registration for the hostel accommodation itself had its own problems. She discovered that she did not take to any of her three roommates in the beginning. There were four girls in the room, Salma herself from the North, Tomiwa from the West, specifically from Ibadan, Ngozi from Umunze in Imo State and Ada from Benue State or Middle Belt as she insisted people called her place of birth.
