"Where are you from?"
"I am from the north. Is there a problem, sir?"
"No," Dabo said and hesitated.
It was not normal for him to be short of words. But he seemed suddenly tongue-tied today.
The girl waited.
"May I know you, please?" he said. Even to his ears that sounded clumsy.
"I am a student here, sir. I think that should be knowledge enough."
"I mean I want to know you more intimately."
Salma instinctively knew all along that this was coming. Why it had to come from this sleazy looking lecturer who had nothing to offer was what surprised her. Indeed, it made her angry. What kind of intimate nonsense was he talking about? University lecturer? From what she heard about the man, they said he was highly disciplined and serious. It was never in his character to have anything to do with his students particularly the female students. So why her? And for God's sake, why now? Well, you never know with men.
"What do you mean more intimately?"
"Don't get me wrong. I simply mean I want us to be friends."

Dabo was in deep thought long after Salma had gone.
What kind of trial was this, oh God? Something I have never done! What drove me into disgracing myself like this? For more than ten years I struggled and overcame this temptation, now such a small girl was sent to try us. What kind of life was this? Please, God, let this cup pass over me. Please God, let her not talk. She was so cheeky, this girl. She could do almost anything. Luckily, Dabo thought, I did not do anything that would warrant a serious chastisement from the school authority. I didn't even ask her out. He told himself. He just said he wanted to be friends. What was wrong with that? Everything was wrong with that, an inner voice answered him. Then he remembered he used the word intimacy. Now, that one was
