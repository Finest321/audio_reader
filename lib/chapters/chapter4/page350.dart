interested in you. They would have discussed that before they stopped. Salma did not answer. She just opened the door behind the passenger seat and entered. She closed the door gently behind her.
"Good evening, gentlemen," she said. "I do not know where you are going. But this is Kwangila and I am going to my school, Ahmadu Bello University Zaria."
"Then it is our way you are going. My name is Labaran." The man behind the wheel said, as he changed gear to drive and move on.
"You have not told us your name."
"I will tell you when I am getting off."
About ten minutes later, the car stopped at the Main Gate of Ahmadu Bello University.
"Or would you prefer we take you right in?"
"Sure. If you do not mind, that is."
"Habib, what do you think?"
"By all means let's take her in."
Habib appeared to be less voluble than Labaran and Salma instantly decided if any of them was the owner of that car, it must be Habib. Not that she was particularly thrilled by the prospect of being asked out by Benz owner. But it would certainly be a story worth telling that a certain big man in a big Mercedes Benz had asked her out and she declined. That would make additional name in the entries of the influential people she had consciously turned down. So now, it was immaterial who asked her out, she knew she would say no. To hell with their flashy and expensive car. What kind of girl were they thinking she was? You just gave someone a ride and you were looking for a relationship that would last eternity? Big deal.
The Benz pulled to a stop outside Queen Amina Hall, but none of the male occupants attempted to step out and open the door for Salma. This bravado, stupidity actually, that exemplified who the gentleman was in Europe had no place in Africa. How can a lady whose limbs are in perfect working condition wait for someone to step out of a car, come round to open the door for her before she steps out? The whole thing smirks of waste of time. In any case, Salma was not expecting.
