                              CHAPTER FOUR
    
    Salma casually walked into the office holding her registration files firmly across her chest. She was barely twenty years old then and doubtless in the prime of her youth. She was endowed as a woman and was too willing to flaunt her elegance. She was always dressed in tight-fitting jeans trousers and body hugs top that stopped just short of being indecent. Salma was a reckless dresser and she was all too aware of the femininity she exuded and the effect this had on members of the opposite sex. She revelled in the hunger st saw in the eyes of men as they shamelessly ogled her body when she walked pa them. This was called freedom. She thought. The university had a lot of this and no one could reprimand you for daring to dress the way you wanted so long as your attire stopped just this side of decency.
Doctor Dabo was a highly disciplined lecturer and he was never heard to engage in any form of underhandedness with any female student, or any student for that matter. Today, however, as Salma walked towards him with her registration files across her chest, he felt a lump rise in his throat. He had never seen a girl look so alluring and beautiful. He swallowed hard and chided himself not to disgrace himself. He must not put his reputation on the line. He had been in the university for more than a decade and many students graduated in his hands. They all had singular respect for him. He ensured that he treated his students justly. He was a stickler for time. Consequently, he was always punctual to lectures. His rule was very simple, "Don't come in after me." If he entered the class before you, you did not bother entering. The students knew this. In fact, his punctuality was phenomenal to the extent that the graduating students warned the incoming students beforehand that there was a no-nonsense lecturer who never allowed students into his class once he was there before them.
As for consorting with the female students, God banish the thought. It had never happened. So when this fateful day Salma walked into his office looking seductive and all, Dabo could not explain the sudden palpitation of his heart. The weather was cold outside, but he was sweating inside. What was happening to me? He asked himself. He cleared his throat and promised himself to dispose of her registration case as quickly as he could before he did something he would regret for the rest of his life.
"What can I do for you?" he asked briskly.
"I am a 100Level student coming for registration. They said you are the Level Coordinator and that you are to sign my forms."
Dabo marvelled at the confidence of the girl. 100Level and she was exuding such confidence. She must be a special breed. Almost sassy, he thought inwardly. Dabo's heart was still beating fast.
"Yes. I am the Level Coordinator. Have you been screened?"
"Yes, sir. I was screened. It was from there that they directed me to your office."
"All right then. Let's see if the forms are complete."
She handed him the forms and he studied them carefully. They were
complete. He signed the appropriate columns on the forms and reluctantly pushed the files to Salma.
She hesitated before standing up and walking towards the door.
It could have been her sheer beauty, her physical appearance, or some other inexplicable signal the devil had sent to Dabo's mind. Whatever it was, instead of allowing her to go, Dabo heard himself say, "Wait."
She turned slowly and faced him.
"Sit down, please. Just want to ask you a few questions." Surely that last sentence was not complete. But he wasn't bothered.
Salma sat down.
