Ngozi however could not resist asking her the all-important question that had been at the back of her mind since the death took place.
"Why are you people always in a hurry to bury your dead?"
Salma did not answer.    
Tomiwa however picked up the gauntlet. "What precisely do you mean by that?"
"Take it easy, my dear. I just meant to observe that you people seem eager to bury your people as soon as they are pronounced dead."
Tomiwa was sitting on top of the bed at the upper bunk, she now jumped down when she heard this. She sat near Salma while she addressed Ngozi.
"There are three things wrong with your observation. The first is that we do not bury people. We bury corpses. As soon as a person is pronounced dead, his personality automatically ceases with his last expiry of breath. The second thing is, we are not eager to bury our dead. We were anxious for them to get well when they were ill, but the moment they die, our anxiety ends and their own begins as creatures bound for a rendezvous with their Creator. We do not want to delay the meeting. Moreover we are religiously enjoined to hasten their funeral, since the more the delay the more anguish that would be unleashed on the family of the bereaved. And thirdly, when you look at it objectively, funeral delay does not have advantages on any one. It does not help the dead. The body would begin to decompose after a while. And it does not matter how well you think you have preserved it. It does not help the bereaved either who are made to grieve several times over."
"What exactly do you mean, Tommy? You cannot be serious." Ngozi said, her tone uncertain. "You mean someone dies and you rush to bury him like he was a nobody. Like he was a nobody? Nodast rites, no lying in state, no waiting for his children and relations to come and bid him final farewell?"
"If the children are around when he dies, fine. Nothing stops them from praying for him there and then and forever thereafter."
"Forever thereafter?"
"Yes, Ngozi. Children pray for their parents and the Lord God would hear their prayers and take pity on the soul of the dead."
"Mhmmm. For us, all good deeds, and bad ones for that matter, cease with the seizure of breath."
"So you do not pray for the dead?"
"No." Ngozi said this with needless emphasis. "Such prayers are like medicine after death, ineffectual."
"So what does RIP mean?"
"What?"
"You heard me the first time. What does RIP mean?"
"It means rest in peace." Ngozi was not sure where the question was leading to.
"Who or what should rest in peace?"
"The soul of the departed."
"I thought you said you do not pray for the dead."
soul."
"We are not praying for the dead. We are praying for the repose of his soul.
