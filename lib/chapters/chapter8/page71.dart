"Whose soul?"
"The dead."
At this juncture even Ngozi herself was not too convinced again.
"So, tell me," Tomiwa said, "why do you delay burials?"
"First, to make sure that we are not burying our relations alive."
"And where do you keep them to ensure that they are alive? The morgue?" Ngozi ignored this remark and let drop what she considered her trump
card.
"The more we delay the funeral the more we allow people, friends and relations who are living far away to come and pay their last respect so that they would not be tormented after the body is interred."
"I think differently, NG. I think family and friends are tormented three times over. First, when the death itself occurs. Second when the body leaves for the mortuary and third on the day of the burial. It kind of stretches the level of torment and the length of sadness."
"But it is our culture."
"Yeah. A very expensive one at that."
"And we are not complaining, Tommy."
"I understand. And neither are we, NG. You bury your dead with so much fanfare after a long period and we bury ours with solemnity as soon as the person is confirmed dead. It does not mean that either of us love their dead less."
As they were going on with this discussion, they heard a whimper and as one they looked at Salma who had been crying all along.
"We are sorry, Sally. How insensitive of us."
Ada went and held her by the shoulder like someone trying to rock a child to sleep.
They all gathered around her quietly, sadly. That was how they slept that day, quietly, sadly. Those four people were more like sisters than roommates till they left the
school.
"Mum, this is a very interesting story if you remove the dying bit. I love how the girls relate with one another. It is really interesting." Omar was beside himself.
"Why won't it be interesting," Teemah said, "since it is all about girls?"
"Mum, I hope you are listening to your daughter. Someone is going to lose her teeth in this house."
"And someone would not get their smart phone in this house." Teemah ensured that she came to sit beside me as she said this.
"What do you mean by that, Teemah?"
