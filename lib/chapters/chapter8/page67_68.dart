"Yes, yes. I know her."
"Well then, this is for her, for the money you collected from her, for lying to her and for coming to gamble with her money. And indeed for all the girls you have been deceiving by impersonating one officer of the university or another. She has a tape of your conversation and we are going to make it available to the school authority at the appropriate time. This," he kicked him hard again, "is a message from Kartagi. He said if this is the kind of gambler you are, then you are not fit to be called one. He warned that you should be careful when next you meet him or any of his boys." He kicked him again.
"That is my comeuppance," strangely that was what Kabir heard in his head before he passed out.
Zaki took the money to Labaran. By the time Labaran counted the money and saw there was three hundred thousand naira, he counted fifty thousand and gave to Zaki and held unto the rest.
He had no intention of handing the money over to Habib. This was not betrayal, he reckoned. He justified his act by giving himself three reasons why the money must not go to Honourable Habib: in the first place, Habib was the Speaker of the house, and therefore did not need such a paltry sum as three hundred thousand naira. Secondly, he reasoned that Habib was in no position to know how much he took from Kabir, or if he collected anything at all, because as a perpetual gambler, no one would expect Kabir to even have a kobo on him. Thirdly, and more disturbingly, Labaran was sure that Habib did not give the money to Salma just like that. It was a payment for some service rendered, which service all of them were well too aware of. No. It did not amount to betrayal what he was doing. If it must be categorised then this act of non-remittal would simply appear like a levelling up. After all, he was all prepared not to think about what must have transpired between Salma and Habib as betrayal. It was simply convenience. And this was certainly convenient to him.
At this point, I paused in my narration and asked for a refill of my zobo drink.
Omar seemed to have a million and one questions to ask but he restrained himself.
"Is there anything you want to ask, my dear?" I asked him directly.
"Mum, I just want to know how Honourable Habib ended up."
"I would give anything to know how he ended up myself. But Salma did not say."
"There simply is no justice on this earth."
I did not quickly agree with my son. But I know he was right. It was not in me, as a mother, to underscore his feeling of despondency over the affairs of the world. Or indeed his disenchantment with the social set up as a whole. But he was right. Justice was just ice. Frozen. Perhaps never to thaw until those who matter decided to make it thaw.
"But there is always justice in the hereafter, my son."
"The journey to the hereafter is rather long and tedious, mum. And frankly, I am not in a hurry to go there?"
"Go where?" Bint asked him?
"The hereafter," he replied without thinking.
"I don't want to go there either." Bint was not sure what he was talking
about. But she believed if her brother said he was not in a hurry to go to any place,
then it would be wise for anyone who had sense to delay going to that place as long
as possible.
"That reminds me of the incident that happened when Salma lost her father while she was in the university."
"What happened, mummy?" Teemah asked.
On the eighth day after the funeral, Salma came to the hostel all the worse for wear. She was really looking haggard. It became obvious to anyone who cared to observe that the girl was in mourning. Her friends and roommates, Ngozi, Ada and Tomiwa had collectively gone to commiserate with her for her loss. So when she got back, they saw that she was really down physically and spiritually, they still commiserated with her further.
