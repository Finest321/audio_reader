                              CHAPTER THREE
    
There was a long interminable silence in my narration. I could sense my T children wanted to ask a thousand and one questions. But each and every one of them was lost in their own thoughts. In fact their silence reminded me of my own silence twenty years age when my husband made that revelation. For a long while I could not utter a single wond. Then, after what seemed like eternity, I sighed and told my husband to go to Dr. Samjohen and personally apologise on my behalf. I could not see myself going back to the school to face my HOD after my inexcusable behaviour. My husband understood my plight and agroad. The next week when I chanced upon Dr. Samjohn on the corridor, be greetud me jovially as if nothing ever happened. But then, he was right. Nothing ever happened. It took a while for me so wrestle with my conscience and convince myself that indeed
nothing happened. And life went on as usual. "Mum, what about the quiet end?" Omar mod
"The quiet one? Oh, the story tay husband told me about our neighbour?" "Yes, mummy let's hear that one." All my girls seemed eager to hear that Mory
I stood up to let the blood circulate to my lower limb then resumed my seat and recounted to them the story of the quiet one as my husband sold me
I looked at Omar in the face and told him that the tale I was about to tell would be more relevant to him since he was the one leaving our tiny community to a bigger city. He should not judge people on the face value. Never judge a book by its cover. And he must leam to trust sparingly. You do not just trust everybody you meet
I reminded them that in our little town, almost everyone knew everyone else. In Lafayette, the tradition had since been established that no stranger was hosted or given accommodation without the knowledge and approval of the District Head, the Hakimi. The wisdom of this tradition was to ensure that no criminal or
fugitive from justice was harboured or accommodated in the village. Our culture of
neighbourtiness was superlative. This was contrary to what obtained in the town. 
   In the town everybody came and vent as they pleased. Indend, it was not inconceivable that tu people living on the same street, or even next door neighbours could live for years without knowing who the other person was. lo Lafayette the story was different. Everybody knew everybody else. In the case of the quiet one, everybody knew when he was horn, er mire precisely the circumstance of his birth
His parents were bona fide citizens of Lafayette and they were known w be a very pious and humble couple. For several years after they were married they did not have children. It appeared, so the elders said, when they were abs giving up, they consulted the services of a formidable boka, a traditional medicine man, and their wishes were granted. People give different interpretations to what actually transpired. While some believed that the hole gave them some potent concoction for instant fertility, others believed that he was indeed the one who fathered the child. In either case, Talle was the result. He was called Talle on account that shortly after his birth, his mother died. Thus the secret of how he was fathered remained a secret. His father married another woman who also did not give birth to any child. So she helped in the upbringing of Talle.
