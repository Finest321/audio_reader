 "Who among you wants to follow them to town to report what is happening there?" the Hakimi turned to his courtiers and other members of the community who had earlier trooped in to complain that Talle was observed buying more foodstuff than he was used to buying. They had observed the trend for almost one week before they decided to take action.
The people cringed and turned their gaze away from the Hakimi.
"Well, then," the policeman said, "since nobody is following us to town, we would adequately inform you through the Hakimi whatever happened later." He then turned to Zaki.
"Is this the Talle you told us about?" he asked.
Zaki nodded.
The policeman raised his baton, "Can't you talk?"
"Yes, yes. He is the one. That is Talle."
"Ok. Let's go."
Two other police constables dragged Talle up and whisked him out of the Hakimi's residence and into the waiting police van. As they drove slowly towards Talle's house, the people, hitherto reluctant to follow Talle to town, now willingly followed the police vehicles to Talle's house.
Once there, the policemen followed Talle into the house and shortly thereafter came out with a young boy of no more than thirteen years old.
Talle was already handcuffed. He was hoisted unto the waiting vehicle where Zaki was and the boy sat in the front seat with the leading police officer who obviously was the IPO, the Investigating Police Officer. The vehicles zoomed off and left Lafayette as hurriedly as they entered. That was the last anybody in the community saw of Talle. There was a rumour going on some years later that he was sighted in the border town up north where smuggling thrived. This rumour was however unconfirmed and it fizzled out as fast as it started.
Of course the Hakimi reported that the IPO sent a message detailing what happened in the Talle saga. Talle and his fellow conspirators were sentenced to some years of imprisonment with hard labour for kidnapping and extortion.
The story the police told was intriguing in its simplicity. Talle was pressed for money and he went to town on a weekend and he met Zaki. Zaki had a better idea. He told Talle that at the GRA, there was this businessman friend of his who would always be seen driving with his son in his car. If they could abduct the son, Zaki was sure the father would pay anything for ransom. Somehow the boy was drugged and abducted and in the middle of the night they brought the boy to Talle's house in Lafayette and kept him for one week before the police came and freed the boy. The boy's father had been contacted and warned never to involve the police. The father reasoned that the kidnappers were amateurs since their asking price was one million and later came down to two hundred and fifty thousand naira. Zaki was arrested at the point of collecting the ransom.
"Wow. That is some story, mum." Omar said. "It appears to be a general admonition to all of us. Why do you say it is of particular interest to me?"
I smiled and said, "My son, you are like that young boy in the story. You are going to the university. Do not trust anyone."
"Surely, mum..."
"I understand. Of course you will make friends and all that. Just be careful."
"If he likes, let him trust everybody," Teemah said.
"Mum, I'll..."
"Yes, I know what you will do. But whatever you would do, don't get mixed with bad company."
"Like kidnappers, mum?"
"Nope. Like cultists and those who engage in EMAL."
"E-MAIL?"
"EMAL. Exams malpractice."
"Oh, it was an acronym too?"
"It has many names."
"Surely, I will avoid that."
"You remember Salma?"
Bint raised her hand as if attempting to answer a question in the classroom.
"Yes, my dear?"
"Salma is that student who embarrassed herself during your registration."Bint declared.
