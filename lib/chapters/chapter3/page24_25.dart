came and parked before the entrance of the Hakimi's residence, the whole thing spelt something ominous. This had never happened in the history of Lafayette community. People thus surged to find out what was going on.
On hearing the siren from outside, Talle sprang up and bolted into the Hakimi's house. The courtiers pursued him and brought him back. This act of attempting to run, confirmed to the people that if nothing else, Talle was guilty of something. But guilty of what? Nobody knew.
"What's wrong with you man? Why are you suddenly scared of a siren?" one of the courtiers asked.
Before Talle could respond, three policemen, armed to the teeth, barged in on the Hakimi and his courtiers.
"Is this the palace of Hakimin Lafayette?" one of the mean looking policemen asked.
"Yes." The Hakimi replied simply and added, "I am the Hakimi."
"We are looking for one of your subjects in connection with kidnapping, armed robbery and extortion."
"That is impossible," the Hakimi said. "We are a quiet and peace loving people here. Our community has never apprehended even a common thief, let alone a kidnapper."
"Well, well, we learnt differently." The policeman turned to one of his colleagues and said, "Go and bring Zaki in here."
"Zaki?" Everybody was shocked as Talle repeated the name. He swooned and fell. Those who observed at close range noticed that he actually urinated on his person.
"Do you have a person named Talle in this village?"
"Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihir raji'un." The Courtier said.
"We did not ask you for any supplication, the police officer said sarcastically.
"That was more of a pious resignation to reality," the Hakimi said and added, "It means from Allah we came and unto him is our returning."
"Let your man spare me his Arabic lessons. Do you have a guy named Talle here or don't you? And why is this guy sprawled on the floor?" the policeman was impatience personified. He did not even give the Hakimi the respect strangers were supposed to accord him.
"That is the Talle you are asking after?" one of the courtiers volunteered.
"Oh, in that case our search is over." The policeman now turned to the Hakimi and said, "Who can take us to his house?"
"He will do that himself. But what is all this about?"
"We told you that this man is an accessory to kidnapping and extortion."
Just then, the other policeman that was sent to bring Zaki came back
dragging an obviously battered Zaki who was chained arms and legs. On the sight of the chained and manacled Zaki, Talle doubled over and, if that were possible, fainted a second time.
"Get up, my friend," the policeman said curtly brandishing a kick at Talle's middle. Talle staggered up and immediately began declaring his innocence.
"Believe me, officer, I am innocent." Talle said. "It was Zaki's idea. He was the one who said they had a neighbour in town..."
"Shut up, my friend. Nobody asked you anything. Just take us to the house, your house"" the policeman growled.
The Hakimi was beside himself with confusion. He had never before witnessed anything like this. And he had been Hakimi in Lafayette for over thirty years. And, come to think of it, if any act of misdeed were to be suspected in this humble village, Talle was the last person that would come to anybody's mind. Now it appeared Talle was not only neck deep in whatever he was being accused, he was even trying to rationalize it. God, you really never know with men. Who would have thought... but what was it really that they had done?
"Excuse me, officer," the Hakimi cleared his throat.
"Yes?" The policeman turned to the Hakimi.
"Whatever it is that this man here would have done, it is expedient that you take a witness from here so that we can explain his absence to those who may wish to know something about his whereabouts."
"Please yourself, Hakimi." But I can assure you that this man here would be absent for a very long time."
